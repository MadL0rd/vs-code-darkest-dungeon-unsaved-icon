# Darkest Dungeon Unsaved File Icon Extension

Welcome to the most **stressful VS Code extension** you'll ever use! ðŸŽ©

Are you tired of that boring default circle icon for unsaved files in VS Code? Do you long for the thrill of seeing your stress level rise every time you forget to save? Well, welcome to **Darkest Dungeon Unsaved File Icon Extension**!

This extension replaces the unsaved file icon with the **Stress Icon** from the cult-classic game **Darkest Dungeon**. Because coding isn't stressful enough already.

## Features

- Replaces the default unsaved file circle icon with the iconic Stress Icon from Darkest Dungeon.
- Adds a touch of "darkest despair" to your VS Code experience.
- A constant reminder that your sanity is on the line until you hit that save button.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
3. Search for "Darkest Dungeon Unsaved File Icon".
4. Click **Install**.

## Usage

1. Open or create a file in VS Code.
2. Make some changes but don't save them.
3. Gaze upon the Stress Icon and feel the mounting pressure to save your file.
4. Hit save (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`) and breathe a sigh of relief.

## Why?

Because developers deserve a little more drama in their lives, and unsaved files are serious business. This extension is the perfect way to remind yourself that coding is a roguelike experienceâ€”high risk, high reward.
